# pricey


Pricey is a simple and effective expense tracker.
Users can add expenses with a few click, edit the date of submission and add categorise to each expense.

Some simple analysis allows the user to see on what type of things he spent money one during a defined amount of time. Added visual representations give the user an overview over where they are spending their money.

They can set goals (e.g. spend no more than 500 CHF on car monthly) and visualize how close they are to speending too much money.


Design Principles: The goal is to make it as easy and effortless for the user to track expenses, so each task-to-be-done for the user should be able to be done in as few clicks as possible.

For this project I will mainly be using Flask and add additional libraries if necessary.

A potential feature might be a simple scanner, which allows to read and import from receits.
